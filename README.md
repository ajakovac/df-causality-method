# df-causality-method

In this repository the codes used to write the paper *Unified Causality Analysis Based on the Degrees of Freedom* are uploaded.

In the paper there are two types of computations. One is a **semi-analytic calculation** of a system evolved by linear stochastic equations, and constrained different number of past elements by Gaussian distributions with various variance. The files in the folder `semi_analytic_method` can be used for the linear analysis. The package `constraintSystem.py` containes the evaluation of the expected values and variances of the different constrain system. The plots of the paper (and much more) can be generated by the file `paperPlots_complete.py`. The resulting plots are saved in the local `Plots` folder.

The other is a **numerical calculation** using the chicken-egg dataset (W.N Thurman, M.E. Fisher *et.al.* Chickens, eggs, and causality, or which came first, American journal of agricultural economics 70, 2, 1988). The data files are the `Ch0.csv` and `Eg0.csv` for chicken and eggs, respectively. The data analysis is in `chickenegg.ipynb` notebook file.
